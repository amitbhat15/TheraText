# TheraText
Health++ Hackathon Theratext Submission

Texting System for therapy patients who find it difficult to meet up with their therapist often. Once a patient texts the hotline, our algorithm performs a sentiment analysis on the text, using a conversion of words to vectors and determining values for given based on positive vs negative connotation measurements we created from Kaggle datasets.

Depending on the measurements given by our algorithm, the program then recommends a course of action, such as forwarding the patient to a hotline answerer to talk to or recommending to the therapist that the patient is doing well.
